# Sinkar v0.2.6

Sinkar is a local desktop app that lets you select one of your github repositories and basically creates a static html web page logic, and provides you a beautiful and simple interface to manage all you articles. Simply I am developing this for Github Pages. Why shouldn't we have something like Wordpress admin panel for github pages?

## Further Plans.
- Opportunity to deploy custom pages (basically custom static pages bundled and provided in the webpage(in case you want to share some custom static webpages under a page name))
- Improvements on theming.
- SEO configurations for your articles.
